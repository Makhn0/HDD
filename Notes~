a: succeeded all guys were written a time not recorded
erasure all zeros
a0:
latest erase time: 12:4:41 block size ~1<- this result is in question; used end instead of end_t in source code, possibly.
result unfinished? fixed.
wiped entire drive

b:
begins erase, but stops... fixed.
erased, much quicker, quicker than time displayed;
akil checking... done success!
b0:
stops at LBA=8milllion for no apparent reason... divide by zero errors
other drive was insanely quick will try that one later swiched drives, 
crazy quick with old drive also 
testing w/ akil ... utterly failed.
	first 100,000 sectors random data, the rest was all still b's
	last sector of 512 bytes was zero
	`wtf???
