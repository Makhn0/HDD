problems
1.drives not detected on mhdd
old questions
1. why did old sample of drives have incomplete erasing?
2. do the  current processes, 2-step, mhdd and ewhde do the same? 
mhdd questions:
1.smartcontrol; ?? command
2.detect in bios for faster erase
3.scan z=2, ?what is erase delay?
4.will other commands work in batchfile?


smartctl vs mhdd scan
?1.what do they do? are they the same?
