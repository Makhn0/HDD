a: succeeded all guys were written a time not recorded
erasure all zeros
a0:
latest erase time: 12:4:41 block size ~1<- this result is in question; used end instead of end_t in source code, possibly.
result unfinished? fixed.
wiped entire drive

b:
begins erase, but stops... fixed.
erased, much quicker, quicker than time displayed;
akil checking... done success!
b0:
stops at LBA=8milllion for no apparent reason... divide by zero errors
other drive was insanely quick will try that one later swiched drives, 
crazy quick with old drive also 
testing w/ akil ... utterly failed.
	first 100,000 sectors random data, the rest was all still b's
	last sector of 512 bytes was zero
	`wtf???
tryin again... failed again
debugging from home.. no I'm not
tryin "patriot" ssd, checking if erased (akill)... is random
moving on to writing c on "patriot"...
appears to be working as normal
THEORY: the <<operator is interpreting the block char array filled with zeros as a null pointer which is why it doesn't write anything.
FIX: using .write instead of <<..
c: filling patriot with c's... inconsistenty detected error???wtf??... however akill finds all bytes are c error was thrown
d: filling intel with .write method...done, confirmed success
d0: filling intel with zeros w/ .write method...done,confirmed success!!:)
c0: filling patriot with zeros w/ .write... done, confirmed
if I find error again, I will adjust begin time and try to catch the errors
e: test intel w/ smart

getting rid of -D_Debug and having adding print etc. makes a ~10 min erase time ~370 min!!!


long time since last entry. Where am I now?
method copied from nwipe 100/9% faster on one drive, will use that for now on, can change later
afraid some of my modifications to the nwipe algorithm won't catch certain problems with drives that nwipe might've

need to:

- test bb_test 

1. run ..._smart.zsh
2. run ..smart0.zsh
3. run smartctl ...
make sure those that pass 0, but would fail bb, do fail new _smart.zsh
skipping smartctl test, bb_test seemed to work, but ran into trouble when it was part of whole process

now running smart0.zsh on all trying over

- try out the whole thing, adjust as go, think its ready for field testing

-eventually change update home to put bin in /bin/
-add log output
